# MockMate

MockMate is an AI-powered interview platform with separate `backend` and `frontend` services, designed to help candidates practice interviews and/or help recruiters run AI-assisted interview sessions.

## Features

- AI-driven interview question generation powered by Gemini
- Candidate response evaluation
- REST API for interview session management
- Responsive frontend for conducting/practicing interviews

## Tech Stack

| Frontend | Backend | AI & Storage |
|---|---|---|
| React.js | FastAPI | Google Vertex AI |
| Ant Design (UI library) | Uvicorn (ASGI server) | Gemini-2.0-flash |
| Axios (API calls) | Python 3.12+ | MongoDB Atlas |
| React Toastify | Pydantic | |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Python 3.12+
- Node.js and npm
- A MongoDB Atlas cluster
- A Google Cloud project with Vertex AI enabled (for Gemini-2.0-flash access)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tiyaagarwal/MockMate.git
   cd MockMate
   ```

2. Set up the backend
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up the frontend
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the required keys, for example:

```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path_to_your_service_account_json
GCP_PROJECT_ID=your_gcp_project_id
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash
PORT=8000
```

### Running the App

1. Start the backend
   ```bash
   cd backend
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
   ```

2. Start the frontend
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (frontend) — the API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

## Usage

Once both servers are running, open the frontend in your browser, start an interview session, and interact with the AI interviewer in real time. Responses are evaluated and stored via the backend, with session data persisted in MongoDB Atlas.
